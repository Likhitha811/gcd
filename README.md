Greatest common divisor computation using EUCLID'S algorithm which invloves the design of datapath and controlpath.
The design is done using Verilog HDL in Xilinx Vivado and tested by writing tesbench for different vaues.
Later Implemented this design on Nexys DDR4 fpga board where switches are accessed to give input by the user and
seven segment display is used to dispplay the given input numbers as well as the calculated output.
